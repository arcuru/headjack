Jack into [Matrix](https://matrix.org/)

This is a Matrix bot framework for Rust.
It wraps the matrix-rust-sdk to provide an easier interface for writing bots in Rust, and handles most of the stuff you'd need to write yourself if you were to write your own bot.

## Project using this

- [chaz](https://github.com/arcuru/chaz): Connect Matrix with any LLM service.
- [pokem](https://github.com/arcuru/pokem): Send notifications using HTTP requests, or a CLI app.
